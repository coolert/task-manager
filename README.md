## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Quick Start

### Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder
```

Default stack includes:
- PHP 8.2
- Redis (for JWT blacklist & caching)
- MySQL
- Laravel Sail runtime

To reset DB:
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

---

### Authentication

```bash
POST /api/auth/login
# Request
{ "email": "demo@example.com", "password": "password" }

# Response
{
  "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJh...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

Other endpoints:

| Method | Route | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | Get current user info |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/refresh` | Refresh JWT |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/logout` | Invalidate token (Redis blacklist) |

---

## üîê Auth & Permissions

### Role Model
Each **project** defines access for 4 roles:

| Role | Description | Can Manage Members | Can Edit Tasks | Can Delete Project |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Owner** | Project creator | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Admin** | Delegated manager | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| **Member** | Contributor | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (own tasks) | ‚ùå |
| **Viewer** | Read-only | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### Policy Enforcement
- **`ProjectPolicy`**
  - `view`, `update`, `delete`, `manageMembers`, `transferOwnership`, `viewLabels`, `manageLabels`
- **`TaskPolicy`**
  - `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `assign`, `claim`, `comment`, `label`

Policies are automatically resolved via Laravel‚Äôs `authorizeResource()` or manual `$this->authorize()` calls.


### Middleware
`EnsureProjectMember`
Ensures the authenticated user belongs to the target project;
resolves project from either route `{project}` or `{task}`.

---

## üß± Domain Models

| Model | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User** | Implements `JWTSubject`, provides login + token refresh |
| **Project** | Owner, Name, Description, Soft Deletes |
| **ProjectMember** | Maps users to projects with role |
| **Task** | Belongs to Project, has Assignee, Creator, Labels, Comments |
| **Label** | Project-scoped tags with unique (name + project_id) |
| **TaskComment** | User-authored comment per task |
| **TaskLabel** | Pivot table between Tasks and Labels |

---

## üß© Seeding Profiles

| Profile | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `mini` | Minimal dataset for CI & quick local testing |
| `demo` | Larger dataset for screenshots or perf testing |

Configure via `.env`:
```bash
SEED_PROFILE=mini
```

---

## üß™ Testing

All feature tests use Pest and run in parallel for faster CI.

### Run All Tests
```bash
composer test:parallel
```

### What‚Äôs Covered
- Auth & JWT (login / refresh / logout)
- Project CRUD, transfer, soft delete
- Member add/remove/update roles
- Label CRUD, conflict checks, task association
- Task CRUD, assign, claim, comment
- Validation & Policy boundaries (403, 404, 409, 422, etc.)
- Redis-backed JWT blacklist persistence
- CI-safe SQLite testing

### Example Assertion
```php
requestAs($user, 'POST', '/api/tasks/1/claim')
    ->assertOk()
    ->assertJsonPath('data.assignee.id', $user->id);
```

---

## ‚ö° CI/CD

The complete CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
It includes:

- Dependency installation (`composer install`)
- `.env.testing` initialization & JWT secret generation
- Database migration & seeding (SQLite)
- Redis service setup (for JWT blacklist)
- Code style check (Pint)
- Static analysis (PHPStan level 6)
- Parallel feature testing (Pest)

Example excerpt:

```yaml
jobs:
  php:
    services:
      redis:
        image: redis:7
        ports: ["6379:6379"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      - run: composer install
      - run: php artisan jwt:secret --env=testing --force
      - run: composer test:parallel
```

Runs full pipeline:
- Lint (Pint)
- Static analysis (PHPStan)
- Migrate + Seed (SQLite)
- Redis service
- Parallel feature tests (Pest)

Each PR runs the same suite to ensure code quality and regression safety.

## üß† Design Decisions

This project was intentionally designed to follow **clean backend engineering principles**
rather than simple CRUD scaffolding. Each layer has a clear purpose:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Policy + Middleware Instead of Hardcoded Role Checks
Instead of writing `if ($user->id !== $project->owner_id)` in controllers,
authorization is centralized in **Policy classes** (`ProjectPolicy`, `TaskPolicy`),
while cross-cutting ‚Äúmembership checks‚Äù are handled by a middleware (`EnsureProjectMember`).
- This separation makes **controller actions clean**, and **access control auditable & testable**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Form Requests + DTOs
Each request class (`*Request`) focuses only on validation and sanitization,
then transforms validated data into a **DTO** (`*DTO`) used by services.
- This ensures the service layer receives **typed, intentional inputs**
instead of arbitrary arrays ‚Äî improving **readability**, **static analysis**, and **testability**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Service Layer (Application Logic)
Controllers are intentionally kept thin:
- Authorization handled by Policies
- Validation handled by FormRequests
- Business logic encapsulated in dedicated Service classes

Example:
```php
public function store(LabelStoreRequest $request, Project $project, LabelService $service): JsonResponse
{
    $this->authorize('manageLabels', $project);
    $dto   = $request->toDTO();
    $label = $service->createLabel($dto);
    return LabelResource::make($label)->response()->setStatusCode(201);
}
```
Each controller method focuses on composition, not logic ‚Äî typically only a few lines of code.

- Keeps the system **modular**, easy to maintain, and ready for refactoring
(e.g., introducing queues, event broadcasting, or domain events later).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Classes for Consistent API Responses
Each model has a corresponding `*Resource` defining **public JSON structure**.
- Guarantees consistency across endpoints,
and lets you control response shape separately from database schema.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Redis-Backed JWT Blacklist
JWT logout is handled using a **Redis-based blacklist**.
This allows instant token invalidation and testable token lifecycle behavior
(e.g., tokens are truly rejected after logout).
- Demonstrates understanding of **stateful JWT** handling, not just ‚Äútoken = string‚Äù.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Strict Static Analysis
Static checks are enforced via **PHPStan (level 6)** and **Pint**.
Generics (`@template`, `@extends`, `@mixin`) are used in DTOs and Resources,
ensuring **type-safe data transformation** even within dynamic Laravel code.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Full Boundary Test Coverage
Every controller endpoint has corresponding feature tests.
All **roles**, **validation states**, and **conflict edge cases (409/422)** are asserted.
- Confirms behavior from user perspective, not just happy paths.

---

**In short:**
This project demonstrates how to design maintainable, testable APIs
with clean separation of concerns, consistent validation, and verifiable authorization.

It‚Äôs not about using every Laravel feature ‚Äî it‚Äôs about using Laravel effectively to build reliable, scalable backend systems.
